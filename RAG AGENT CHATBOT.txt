********
scraping data->turning it into vectors->use it as our ressources for the chatbot(to get the up to date responses based on our needs)+profitable because its free(no need to buy key api).
***technologies:
****************
langchain,nodejs,react
***topics u need to understand :
********************************
Definition of RAG
Vector embeddings
DataStax Vector Database
OpenAI

***********************************************
is when you change the output of a LLM(large language model) by providing the mdel more context alongside a user's input => to generate more precise answers based on the user's needs (in other words extending the power of llm).

second case senario: if the data does not even eist in the llm
***prequeties:
**************
nodejs v20
openAI account
***Vector Embedings:
********************
its a technique to represent information in a format that can be processed by a certain algorithm to have a semantic meaning to the model.
***steps:
*********
create an open ai account
